# GeoRiders
Mobile game which makes use of sensors and a database.
I added quite a lot of features and animations to discover how Android Studio reacts in different situations. I have to say that I learnt a bit and I will definitely make use of the acquired skills in the future projects.
I might upload the app to the Google Play store sometime soon but firstly I need to make sure I am utterly happy with the final result.

Feel free to message me if any clarification is needed. 
MJS :)
